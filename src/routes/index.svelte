<h1>(Pf) => Pure Function LLC</h1>

<p class="center">_|_</p>
<p>Pure Function focuses on developing state of the art, user driven, web applications.</p>
<p>
  Code, we believe, should follow function. It should be accessible both by all end users as well as by developers. This
  means working closely with our clients to translate their vision into code, and doing so using best practices for
  development, testing, security and accessibility while making the code readable and easy to maintain.
</p>
<p class="center">===</p>
<p>We have experience in the federal space, as well as in the academic and business worlds.</p>
